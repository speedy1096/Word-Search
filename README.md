# Word-Search
To Run the project execute the main.exe file and you will be promoted to enter 
a 12 letter word. 

Once you enter a word it will be placed on the board. If the word is not placed 
on the board the program will tell you. This occurred becuase the word did not 
fit in the random space selected. You can try and enter the word again, and it
may be placed on the board.

Once you are done entering words you can type 66 and hit enter to exit the program.

The word search will be outputted to the search.txt file with the word bank. I
recommend that you screen shot this file and paste the image in a word 
document for easy resizing.
